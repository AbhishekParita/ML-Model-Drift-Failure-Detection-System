## 🎯 The Problem

Fraud costs financial institutions **billions of dollars annually**, with fraudulent transactions evolving constantly to evade detection. Traditional ML models degrade over time due to:

- **Data Drift**: Changes in transaction patterns that make models less accurate
- **Silent Failures**: Models that continue predicting but perform poorly on new data
- **Behavioral Anomalies**: Unusual patterns that indicate fraud or system issues

This system provides **real-time monitoring** to detect drift, track model performance, and alert on behavioral anomalies—ensuring your fraud detection stays reliable in production.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 **Data Drift Detection**
- Statistical tests (KS test, Chi-Square) to detect feature distribution changes
- Real-time comparison against reference data
- Automated drift scoring and alerts

### 🔍 **Silent Failure Monitoring**
- Tracks prediction patterns and confidence scores
- Detects anomalies in model behavior
- Monitors feature importance shifts

### 📈 **Behavioral Monitoring**
- Rule-based alert system for transaction anomalies
- High-value transaction tracking
- Suspicious pattern detection

### 🔔 **Alert System**
- Real-time alerts for drift and behavioral issues
- Severity-based prioritization
- Historical alert tracking and dashboard

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Inference & Monitoring
- `POST /predict` - Make fraud predictions and log data
- `GET /drift` - View drift detection dashboard
- `GET /behavior` - View behavioral alerts dashboard
- `GET /alerts` - View all system alerts

### Testing Drift Detection
```bash
# Run drift detection on new data
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/check_drift" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample_data.json
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Test drift detection
python test_silent_shift.py

# Test alert system
python test_alerts.py

# Test monitoring pipeline
python test_monitoring_pipeline.py

# End-to-end tests
python tests/test_end_to_end.py
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Alerts Table
Stores drift and behavioral alerts:
- `id`: Unique alert identifier
- `timestamp`: When the alert was triggered
- `alert_type`: Type (drift, behavior, silent_failure)
- `severity`: low, medium, high, critical
- `message`: Alert description
- `details`: JSON with additional context

Query alerts:
```bash
python query_alerts.py
```
